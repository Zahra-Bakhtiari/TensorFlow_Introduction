# Tensor_Flow_Introduction

Machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Keras, and many others can speed up machine learning developments significantly. TensorFlow 2.3 has made significant improvements over its predecessor, some of which we will encounter and implement in this repository. In this notebook [Introduction to TensorFlow](https://github.com/Zahra-Bakhtiari/TensorFlow_Introduction/blob/main/Tensorflow_introduction.ipynb) below topics will be covered:

1) Using tf.Variable to modify the state of a variable
2) Explaining the difference between a variable and a constant
3) Training a Neural Network on a TensorFlow dataset
